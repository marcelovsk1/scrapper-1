    "title": "SOUK 19: on the cutting edge of Montréal design",
    "description": "For its 19th edition, the SOUK, a major avant-garde and contemporary Montréal design showcase, makes a fresh start in a former textile factory at the heart of Mile-Ex’s Architects District. From November 29 to December 3, 2023, the crème de la crème of Montréal’s up-and-coming designers will come together in a new setting to showcase their wares in true SOUK fashion. In collaboration with Sid Lee Architecture, the SOUK will transform the floors of this vacant building into a raw, minimalist backdrop to artisanal ingenuity. This impressive project looks to promote local design and foster exchanges while honouring the history of the site and its industrial past.",
