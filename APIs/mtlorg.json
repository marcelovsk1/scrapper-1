    "description": "For its 19th edition, the SOUK, a major avant-garde and contemporary Montréal design showcase, makes a fresh start in a former textile factory at the heart of Mile-Ex’s Architects District. From November 29 to December 3, 2023, the crème de la crème of Montréal’s up-and-coming designers will come together in a new setting to showcase their wares in true SOUK fashion. In collaboration with Sid Lee Architecture, the SOUK will transform the floors of this vacant building into a raw, minimalist backdrop to artisanal ingenuity. This impressive project looks to promote local design and foster exchanges while honouring the history of the site and its industrial past.",

    "description": "Montréal during the day and Montréal during the night is a tale of two cities. After dark, the city transforms: the bare stone walls of Old Montréal become history projected, while the Jacques-Cartier Bridge lights up in flashes of colour over the St. Lawrence River. Building facades in the entertainment district turn into movie screens, and the power of light to trick the eye gives some of Montréal’s first buildings all new life. Here’s just a few of Montréal’s light installations you won’t want to miss.",
